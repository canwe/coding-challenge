# Area 51

## Solution

Using a tool like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) we are able to try out multiple HTTP methods. It appears that `GET` and `POST` are protected but not the others. Using `PUT`:

```
<div class="challenge-wrapper">
	<br />
	<span class="red">AREA 51</span> The origin of the Area 51 name is unclear? Alien?
	<br />
	<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">FLAG-w4KRr557y626izv567758O52</div>
	<br />
	<br />
</div>
```

And we obtain the Flag `FLAG-w4KRr557y626izv567758O52`
